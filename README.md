# Machine-Learning-with-Python-Projects

These are the 5 projects I completed as part of the [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) Certification by freeCodeCamp in August 2022.

This certification covered how to use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning. It also dives into neural networks, teaching the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.

My certificate can be found on this [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc3f66bd3b-39fe-455f-98a5-b758727953c9/machine-learning-with-python-v7).
